# "merge" defines how and when pull requests are merged. If the section is
# missing, bulldozer will consider all pull requests and use default settings.
merge:
  # "whitelist" defines the set of pull requests considered by bulldozer. If
  # the section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests not excluded
  # by the blacklist.
  whitelist:
    # Pull requests with any of these labels (case-insensitive) are added to
    # the whitelist.
    labels: ["merge when ready"]

    # Pull requests where the body or any comment contains any of these
    # substrings are added to the whitelist.
    comment_substrings: ["==MERGE_WHEN_READY=="]

    # Pull requests where any comment matches one of these exact strings are
    # added to the whitelist.
    comments: ["Please merge this pull request!"]

    # Pull requests where the body contains any of these substrings are added
    # to the whitelist.
    pr_body_substrings: ["==MERGE_WHEN_READY=="]

  # "blacklist" defines the set of pull request ignored by bulldozer. If the
  # section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests. It takes the
  # same keys as the "whitelist" section.
  blacklist:
    labels: ["do not merge"]
    comment_substrings: ["==DO_NOT_MERGE=="]

  # "method" defines the merge method. The available options are "merge",
  # "rebase", and "squash".
  method: merge
  
  # Allows the merge method that is used when auto-merging a PR to be different based on the 
  # target branch. The keys of the hash are the target branch name, and the values are the merge method that 
  # will be used for PRs targeting that branch. The valid values are the same as for the "method" key.
  # Note: If the target branch does not match any of the specified keys, the "method" key is used instead.
  # branch_method:
  #   develop: squash
  #   master: merge

  # "options" defines additional options for the individual merge methods.
  options:
    # "squash" options are only used when the merge method is "squash"
    squash:
      # "body" defines how the body of the commit message is created when
      # generating a squash commit. The options are "pull_request_body",
      # "summarize_commits", and "empty_body".
      body: "summarize_commits"
      # if "body" is "pull_request_body" then the commit message will be part
      # of the pull request body delinated by "message_delimiter" string
      message_delimiter: ==COMMIT_MSG==

  # "required_status" is a list of additional status contexts that must pass
  # before bulldozer can merge a pull request. This is useful if you want to
  # require extra testing for automated merges, but not for manual merges.
  # required_statuses:
  #   - "ci/circleci: ete-tests"

  # If true, bulldozer will delete branches after their pull requests merge.
  delete_after_merge: true

# "update" defines how and when to update pull request branches. Unlike with
# merges, if this section is missing, bulldozer will not update any pull requests.
update:
  # "whitelist" defines the set of pull requests that should be updated by
  # bulldozer. It accepts the same keys as the whitelist in the "merge" block.
  whitelist:
    labels: ["WIP", "Update Me"]

  # "blacklist" defines the set of pull requests that should not be updated by
  # bulldozer. It accepts the same keys as the blacklist in the "merge" block.
