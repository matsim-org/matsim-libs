/**
 * Sebastian Schneider has done a Ph.D. dissertation about generating freight vehicle chains by essentially re-sampling the information
 * contained in the German survey KiD.  Since the KiD is essentially an activity-based travel diary, the method should also be applicable
 * to other situations.
 * <p/>
 * Since Sebastian has left science for the time being, he allowed me to take his code and integrate it into the matsim repository, under
 * the GPL.  For the time being, it will just "sit" here until someone attempts to make it work.
