/**
 * All values used in this package use SI base and derived units. In particular:
 * <ul>
 * <li>distance - meter [m]</li>
 * <li>time - second [s]</li>
 * <li>energy - joule [J]</li>
 * <li>power - watt [W]</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In particular, the use of [kWh] and [s] generates confusion and leads to bugs, as 1 kWh = 1,000 J
 * * 3,600 s
 * <p>
 * Consequently, energy consumption is measured in [J/m], instead of [kWh/100km] or [Wh/km], as
 * typically done in transport.
