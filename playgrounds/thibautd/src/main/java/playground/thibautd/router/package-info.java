/**
 * This package defines interfaces and classes for trip routing.
 * <br>
 * Trips can consist in any sequence of plan elements. Within-trip
 * activities (<i>stage activities</i>) are identified based on their types.
 * A trip is defined as the longest sequence of plan elements containing
 * only legs and stage activities.
 *
 * <br>
 * It is based on a three layers architecture:
 * <ul>
 * <li> the {@link org.matsim.core.router.RoutingModule}s are responsible for computing trips
 * between individual O/D couples, for a given mode. They moreover provide
 * access to an object allowing to identify their stage activities, implementing
 * {@link org.matsim.core.router.StageActivityTypes}.
 * <li> the {@link org.matsim.core.router.TripRouter} registers {@link org.matsim.core.router.RoutingModule}s for each
 * mode, and allows to route between O/D pairs for any mode. It does not modify the plan.
 * It moreover provides access to a {@link org.matsim.core.router.StageActivityTypes} instance allowing
 * to identify all possible stage activities, for all modes.
 * <li> the {@link org.matsim.core.router.PlanRouter} provides a {@link org.matsim.core.population.algorithms.PlanAlgorithm} to
 * route all trips in a plan.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The behaviour can be modified by implementing custom {@link org.matsim.core.router.RoutingModule}s.
