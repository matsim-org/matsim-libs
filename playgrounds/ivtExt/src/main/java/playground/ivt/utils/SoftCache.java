/**
 * A cache that keeps entries as long as the Virtual Machine is happy
 * with it, using SoftReferences.
 * It is designed to be usable from multiple threads with minimal locking
 * using a ConcurrentHashMap internally.
 * At construction, a daemon thread is started to handle cleaning of the GC'd
 * entries, which gets stopped at most 5 seconds after the cache instance is finalized.
 * <br>
 * Note that the GC often only partially cleans the cache.
 * This blog post gives an idea of which references are kept:
 * http://jeremymanson.blogspot.ch/2009/07/how-hotspot-decides-to-clear_07.html
 * (in short, the JVM is actually uses some kind of LRU heuristic,
 * defined as a minimum time to keep a reference after it is last accessed.
 * This time depends on the free heap space: the bigger the space, the longer the
 * time)
 * <br>
 * To log some statistics about cleared references, set the log level to TRACE
 * for this class.
