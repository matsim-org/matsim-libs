 * <ul>
 *		<li>Convert travel diary data (in the form of MATSim plans) to a dataset for estimating choice models externally
 *			(BIOGEME or similar)	</li>
 *		<li>Compute accessibility as the expected utility from a nested logit model, for each person in a population
 *			(synthetic population or similar)	</li>
