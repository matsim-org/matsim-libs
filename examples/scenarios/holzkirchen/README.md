Abstract: This study introduces an autonomous ride-pooling service to six communities with varying population sizes and trip densities in the Munich Metropolitan Region. We analyze a) a laissez-faire scenario without additional policies, defining the modal shift through an incremental mode choice model and b) a draconian scenario in which each within-city car trip is replaced by ride-pooling. Results indicate a logarithmic increase in system efficiency with increasing trip densities. While the results confirm the potential of ride-pooling systems to reduce private car fleets drastically, a reduction of traveled km is identified for scenarios with more than 1,000 requests per km2 per day.
