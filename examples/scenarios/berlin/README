This scenario is based on a demand as described in:

Rieser, M., K. Nagel, U. Beuck, M. Balmer and J. RÃ¼menapp (2007) Truly
agent-oriented coupling of an activity-based demand generation with a
multi-agent traffic simulation, Transportation Research Record, 2021,
10--17.

Following adaptations have been made:

- only persons with at least one car leg have been taken
- all activities other than work and education (edu) have been removed
- duration of all work/edu activities set to 8 hours.
- the first home activity for all agents ends at 8am 
- 1% subsample taken
