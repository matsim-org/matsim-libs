This file contains a few default scenarios available for tests.
The examples are mantained by Michael Balmer and Marcel Rieser. If you want to
add your own test scenario or need a modification to one of the existing
scenarios, please contact one of the maintainers first. Unauthorized changes 
to the examples will be reverted.

The currently available example scenarios are:


equil
==============================================================================
A synthetic network consisting of 15 nodes and 23 links.
It contains 9 route-alternatives to get from node 2 to 12, all containing a
bottleneck of 1000 veh/h. Thus, this example is often used to test if modules
behave correctly such that a nash-equilibrium can be achieved with enough
iterations.
