## Overview

MATSim provides a toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based
transport simulations. The toolbox consists of several modules which can be
combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by own implementations
to test single aspects of your own work. Currently, MATSim offers a toolbox
for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation),
re-planning, a controller to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to
analyze the output generated by the modules.

All list of available extensions can be found in the [contribs](contribs/README.md) folder.

For more information, see the project website at http://www.matsim.org/.
