/**
 * Attention: This is a simple stop time calculator with quick calculations for
 * *immediate* requests. The calculations in case of prebooking become more
 * complicated, especially in the case of updating end times when dropoffs are
 * added: Because the previously inserted pickup generates a time penalty in
 * InsertionGenerator, not only the newly added dropoff needs to be taken into
 * account here, but also the general shifting of the task. Then we need to
 * evaluate the earliestDepartureTime of all assigned pickups. For that reason,
 * we have a separate implementation that is also valid for prebooking requests,
 * but we keep this one here as it requires less calculations.
