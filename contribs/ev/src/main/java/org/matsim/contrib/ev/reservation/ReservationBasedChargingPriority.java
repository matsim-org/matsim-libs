/**
 * This is an implementation of a charging priority which is backed by the
 * ReservationManager: When a vehicle arrives, it is checked whether a
 * reservation for this vehicle exists for the respective charger and the
 * current time. In that case, the vehicle can be plugged if it is on top of the
 * queue. If not, the ChargingPriority will try to make a reservation and if it
 * is successful, the vehicle can start charging. In all other cases, the
 * vehicle will stay in the queue until it is removed manually or a successful
 * reservation can be made at a future time.
