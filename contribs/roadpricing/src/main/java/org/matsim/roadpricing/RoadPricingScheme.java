	 * scheme indeed uses the person information (or the time), and indeed the 
	 * default implementation of this interface does not use it.
	 * 
	 * Note: Implementations of this interface are expected to be pure, stateless 
	 * data containers. Do not, for example, implement a toll which a user must 
	 * only pay once per day by giving a different cost depending on how often 
	 * his method is called. The interpretation ("when do you pay this amount")

	 * <br>
	 * Design issues:<ul>
	 * 		<li> I have decided to put the person into the method call rather 
	 * 			 than the setPerson construction in TravelDisutility etc.
	 * 			 Reason: A big advantage of agent-based simulation over traditional 
	 * 			 methods is heterogeneity of agent population. But if we make 
	 * 			 this hard to use, the advantage shrinks.  kai, mar'12
	 * 
	 * 		<li> It should truly be based on the vehicle (type).  But since 
	 * 			 vehicles have not yet universally annealed to a robust state, 
	 * 			 I am sticking with persons.  kai, mar'12
	 * 
	 * 		<li> In jan'14 Johan is far enough to use this with vehicles rather 
	 * 			 than persons.  However, I can imagine situations where there 
	 * 			 is also a discount for persons, e.g. disabled or low income.  
	 * 			 Since it is also easier to refactor by just adding the vehId, 
	 * 			 this is what I will do.  kai, jan'14
