/**
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * Execute {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.CreateEmissionConfig} and {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOnlineExample} or {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOfflineExample} from the example package.
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.CreateEmissionConfig}: Creates a MATSim config file with links to emission related input files as {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.utils.EmissionsConfigGroup}. </li>
 * <li> {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOnlineExample}: Writes emission events to the events file during the simulation. </li>
 * <li> {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOfflineExample}: Writes emission events to the events file based on a standard MATSim events file. </li>
 * </ul>
 * The online example as well as the offline example use a config file as created by {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.CreateEmissionConfig}.
 * An example config and the associated files can be found at the test input directory.
 * The example config file allows you to directly run the online example.
 * <p>
 * Please note that the emission values given by the sample files are NOT actual data from HBEFA due to copyright restrictions. In the follwing section, there is a guide how to export these files.
 *
 * <h2>Export from HBEFA 3.x</h2>
 * Currently, data from the HBEFA 3.x Microsoft Access database needs to be exported manually.
 * 
 * Consequently, the following steps within HBEFA 3.x need still be done manually:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> Install and open HBEFA 3.x</li>
 *  <li> Select your country and language</li>
 *  <li> Go to "CaseDefinition" > "New"</li>
 *  <li> Select the desired parameters:</li>
 *   <ul>
 *    <li> VEHICLE CATEGORIES: Currently, PC (passenger car), HGV (heavy goods vehicle), MOTORCYCLE and ZEV (zero emission vehicle) are supported (see {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.HbefaVehicleCategory HbefaVehicleCategory})</li>
 *    <li> COMPONENTS: MATSim will handle any components that are exported from the hbefa database</li>
 *    <li> YEARS: Choose the year of your scenario (only when exporting the mandatory average emission factors files)</li>
 *    <li> FLEET COMPOSITION: Choose "EF weighted with fleet composition" for the mandatory average emission factors files, and "EF per subsegment (without weighting)" for the optional detailed emission factors files</li>
 *    <li> HOT EMISSION FACTORS: Choose "Individual TrafficSituations" > "Construct your own list" > "SelectAll" > "Return"</li>
 *    <li> COLD START EXCESS EMISSION FACTORS: Tick this option and choose "Construct your own list" > select all "patterns" with average temperature, detailed parking time (0-1h .. >12h), and detailed distance (0-1km and 1-2km) > "Return"</li>
 *    <li> Leave everything else as default</li>
 *   </ul> 
 *  <li> Enter "Name of parameter set" and press "Calculate"</li>
 *  <li> Save the two generated tables using "Results" > "Export" to the desired location</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 *  All these emission factor files need to be converted into *.txt or *.csv with ";" as delimiter.
 *  Their column headers should automatically match the parser definition
 *  in the respective method of the {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.EmissionModule}.
 *
 * <h2>Input files</h2>
 * Required files are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>roadTypeMappingFile: This file needs to map road types in your network to HBEFA 3.x road types.
 * Update (June'2018) one can now directly add HBEFA road type to link attributes using {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.EmissionUtils#setHbefaRoadType(org.matsim.api.core.v01.network.Link, java.lang.String)}
 * or see {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.utils.EmissionsConfigGroup} for a detailed description.
 * 
 * <li>emissionVehicleFile: This data type is defined in the EmissionsConfigGroup,
 * see {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.utils.EmissionsConfigGroup}. The following information is surrounded by {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.EmissionUtils.EmissionSpecificationMarker}. It is described as "definition of a vehicle
 *  for every person (who is allowed to choose a vehicle in the simulation):
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> REQUIRED: Vehicle description must start with the respective HbefaVehicleCategory followed by ";"
 *  <li> OPTIONAL: If detailed emission calculation is switched on, the vehicle type Id should additionally contain
 *  HbefaVehicleAttributes ("Technology;SizeClasse;EmConcept"), corresponding to the strings in detailedWarmEmissionFactorsFile (see below) </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Optional: If you want to use vehicle specific emission calculations, set isUsingDetailedEmissionCalculation to <code>true</code> in the
 * {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOnlineExample} or
 * {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.example.RunDetailedEmissionToolOfflineExample} class.
 * Define the input paths for
 * <ul>
 *
 * <h2>Model description</h2>
 * 
 * <h3>Emissions</h3>
 * The main package contains classes and methods to handle the emission input data and create
 * maps to associate the emissions with corresponding vehicle types, speed, parking time, ... <br>
 *
 * <h3>Events</h3>
 * This class contains extensions of {@link org.matsim.api.core.v01.events.Event}
 * to handle different types of emissions as events. <code> ColdEmissionAnalysisModule</code>
 * calculates emissions after a cold start, <code> WarmEmissionAnalysisModule</code> calculates
 * warm emissions.
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 * This class contains the "RunEmissionTool" classes and a control listener which implements
 * some functions from {@link org.matsim.core.controler.Controler Controler}.
 *
 * <h3>Types</h3>
 * {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.HbefaVehicleAttributes} contains a default constructor, setting all values to average.
 * This way a calculation of emissions for undefined vehicle types can be performed.
 * Any instance of {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.HbefaWarmEmissionFactorKey} contains a vehicle category, a warm pollutant; a road category,
 * a traffic situation and three vehicle attributes (technology, size class, em concept).
 * Any instance of {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.HbefaTrafficSituation} specifies one of 5 traffic situations.
 * Instances of {@link org.matsim.contrib.emissions.HbefaColdEmissionFactorKey} contain a vehicle category, a cold pollutant, a parking time range,
 * a distance, which is driven after parking and, again, vehicle attributes.
 * The cold/warm emission factor keys are mapped to the values of cold/warm emissions, the cold/warm emission factors.
