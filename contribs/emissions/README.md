# Emissions

This package provides a tool for exhaust emission calculation based on the "Handbook on Emission Factors for Road Transport" (HBEFA), version 3.1 and 4.1 (see <http://www.hbefa.net>). 
When publishing papers where this emission package is used, please make sure to cite the following two articles:

The probably most detailed documentation of this package can be found in Benjamin's dissertation, available [here](http://www.nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:83-opus4-53489).
For more information see the org.matsim.contrib.emissions package above. 

#### Example files:
You can find some example files in the matsim-examples.
There is also an free to use file for _cold_ emission factors (all set to 0.0) for those vehicle types which does not has values in the database.
