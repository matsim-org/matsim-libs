/**

 * This package contains generic code for iterative optimization using
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated Annealing</a>.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * The idea is that a certain object of the simulation is optimized within the co-evolutionary MATSim
 * framework (e.g., stop network, schedules, etc...). Similar to the co-evolutionary approach of MATSim,
 * simulated annealing tries to optimize iteratively by exploring and evaluating new solutions.
 * In contrast to genetic algorithms, simulated annealing typically work on a single solution at one time.
