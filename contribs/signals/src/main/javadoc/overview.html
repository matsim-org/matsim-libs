The MATSim contrib for traffic lights is able to simulate traffic signals microscopically. 
For fixed-time control a default implementation is provided.  
No programming is required to simulate fixed-time traffic signal control. 
Traffic-responsive signal control needs custom implementation but can benefit from the provided infrastructure. 
<p>
As a starting point please have a look at the tutorials in this contrib and the tutorial in the matsim main distribution.
