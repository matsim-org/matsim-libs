 * The current (jul'22) logic of this is: <ul>

 *         <li> Normally, the strategy manager is fixed infrastructure, and should just be configured.  However, since it is not yet there before
 *         injection, it also cannot be configured before injection.  Core matsim solves that by writing the corresponding configuration into the
 *         config.  We could, in principle, do the same here.  Don't want to do this yet.</li>
 *         <li> So way to configure this "in code" is to bind {@link CarrierStrategyManager >} to a {@link Provider <CarrierStrategyManager>} and then
 *         configure it in the provider. </li>
