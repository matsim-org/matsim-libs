# MATSim Contribs

MATSim offers several extensions which enhance the functionality with additional features. 
The following list gives an overview of the currently available extensions.

Please note that these extensions are usually maintained and provided by single members of the community. 
The MATSim core development team cannot make any guarantee that these extensions will be kept up-to-date and compatible with future releases, instead the maintainers themselves are responsible for this task.
