/**
 * A Schedule contains Tasks. <br/>

 * Design comments:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This interface makes fairly strong assumptions on its implementation. I am wondering a bit if the design purpose
 * might not be better expressed by removing the interfaces and simply have the implementation. kai, feb'17
 * <li>I am happy with Task as an interface. Otherwise casts like (List<DrtTask>)getTasks() would not work (directly).
