 * <ul>
 * <li>This interface makes fairly strong assumptions on its implementation. I am wondering a bit if the design purpose
 * might not be better expressed by removing the interfaces and simply have an implementation class hierarchy. A bit
 * like the MATSim events, which also originally were interfaces with implementations behind them, and at some point we
 * united this again. kai, feb'17
