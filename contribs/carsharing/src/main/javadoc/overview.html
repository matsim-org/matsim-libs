Allows to simulate carsharing modes like station based (one-way, round-trip) or freefloating.
<p>
The main features of the current state are:

<ul>
  <li>Different companies providing carsharing services</li>
  <li>Flexible cost structures per company and per mode</li>
  <li>Membership per operator and per mode</li>
  <li>Infrastructure for models that let people decide should they keep their vehicles during activities</li>
  <li>Infrastructure for models that let people decide from which operator should they rent a vehicle (in case they are members of more than 1)</li>
  <li>Vehicles infrastructure is flexible allowing easy implementation of special vehicles (e.g. electrical)
  <li>More convenient output </li>
  <li>Input is completely separated from default MATSim files (just the config file has to be adapted now)</li>
  <li>(Easy) integration with other modes</li>
</ul>
