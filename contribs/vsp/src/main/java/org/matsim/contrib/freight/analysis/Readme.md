**The package name (org.matsim.contrib.freight) was chosen on purpose.**
It should allow to move the stuff to the freight contrib later without breaking any code.

This package contains some analysis stuff for freight outputs.
The content was created by Jakob Hanisch during the MATSim advanced class 2020/21.

**It is untested and needs some kind of review --> be very careful when using it!**
