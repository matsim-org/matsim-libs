/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains MATSim tutorial files.  In theory, they should be described in "Getting started with MATSim".  In practice, the files here
 * have a tendency to be more modern than the descriptions in the tutorial.  Here is some help:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link tutorial.config} contains files illustrating how to use MATSim by modifying the (xml-)config files only. </li>
 * <li> {@link tutorial.programming} illustrates how one can extend matsim in useful ways, while remaining minimally invasive. </li>
 * </ul>
