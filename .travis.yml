# Status: Somehow, a stage does not seem to pick up the result of the
# previous stage.  For example, even after "mvn package", it attempts to
# download matsim snapshots from the internet.  My next attempt would now be along the lines of
#
# mvn -o -f ~/git/matsim/pom.xml --projects contribs/otfvis --also-make install -DskipTests
# mvn -o -f ~/git/matsim/contribs/otfvis/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.matsim.contrib.otfvis.OTFVis" -Dexec.vmargs="-Xmx2000m" -Dexec.args="$*"

# Well, since the commit of this note will trigger another build, I am giving it a first shot, see below. kai

# Note that you cannot get rid of the "test" stage, and it is the only
# stage that does get matrix-expanded.  So the IT tests need to be run
# in stage called "test".  kai, dec'17

# define the order of the stages:
stages:
  - package
  - test

# this is the script run in the "test" stage:
# 'failsafe:verify' triggers travis failures for errors/failures of integration tests. 
script: mvn install --also-make --projects ${MODULE} -DskipTests && cd ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/${MODULE} && mvn failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify --batch-mode -Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile -Dmatsim.preferLocalDtds=true --fail-at-end

# this defines all other stages.
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: package
      script: mvn package --batch-mode -Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile -Dmatsim.preferLocalDtds=true --fail-at-end

# (would be nice to run this also in parallel with the others.  But it
# is either the matrix thing and then exactly the same command for
# each module.  Or hand-written entries (see .travis.yml.nomatrix),
# which in particular has the disadvantage that one cannot see the
# failing module at the travis toplevel.)
