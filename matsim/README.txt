MATSim

Multi-Agent Transport Simulation

http://matsim.org/
=========================================================================


MATSim provides a framework and toolbox to run and implement
large-scale agent-based transport simulations. It consists of
several modules which can be combined or used stand-alone. Modules can
be replaced by own implementations to test single aspects of your own
work. Currently, MATSim offers a modules for demand-modeling,
agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation),
re-planning, a controller to iteratively run simulations as well as
methods to analyze the output generated by the modules.

USAGE (if you got the zip file):
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Click on matsim-x.y.z.jar or type java -jar matsim-x.y.z.jar
  This should start the GUI (from which you can run the simulation).
- java -cp matsim-x.y.z.jar org.matsim.run.Controler myconfig.xml
  This should run the simulation.
- A Tutorial can be found online: http://matsim.org/docs/tutorials
- Some example files are included in this release, in the "examples" directory.
- If you want to develop code with MATSim, e.g. in Eclipse,
  we rather recommend adding MATSim to your project as a Maven dependency.
