MATSim

Multi-Agent Transport Simulation

http://matsim.org/

Snapshot-Release  (internal number: 0.4.0-SNAPSHOT)
=========================================================================


MATSim provides a toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based 
transport simulations. The toolbox consists of several modules which can be
combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by own implementations
to test single aspects of your own work. Currently, MATSim offers a toolbox
for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation),
re-planning, a controller to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to
analyze the output generated by the modules.

  some example files are included in this release.
- If you want to develop code with MATSim, e.g. in Eclipse:
  add the libs-directory and the matsim-jar to an Eclipse-Project.
  in Eclipes 3.5 or newer, add *only* the matsim-jar to the build-path in Eclipse.
  in Eclipse 3.4 or older, also add all the libs to the build-path.
  you should now be able to use the classes from matsim in your project.
