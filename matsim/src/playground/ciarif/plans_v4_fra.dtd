<!-- More generic version of the enhanced matsim plans dtd.
     It holds home and prim_loc inside the knowledge without
     distinguish them anymore from other locations.
     Coords and link id are now subtags.
     Inside the plans the coords are also subtags. only the linkid
     will be kept because of consistency with the matsim
     relaxation process.
     Also the travelcards element and the zones are removed. -->

<!-- ROOT ELEMENT plans:
     In here all individuals are stored including their desired
     plan. -->

     It is always a good idea to give a plans file a descriptive
     name for better identification.
     Normally it should describe, which company / institute / etc..
     created that plans file and / or what has been modified. -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE reference_layer:
     The name of a layer in the world. <act>s can store a reference
     to a zone/entry in that layer, e.g. to maintain the cell-id

     format := string
     units  := N/A -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT actspace:
     Each person can hold his own activity space of a speciafies
     activity type. but only one act space per type. -->

     format := string
     units  := N/A -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT param:

     the number of parameter needed for different curves. Therefore,
     the description is kept flexible. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE name:
     the name of the parameter. each curve has a set of required
     paramter to describe the actual position. For the two already
     defined curves the parameter are the following:
     ellipse:

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT activity:

     about several locations of a specific activity.

     format := unsigned integer
     units  := N/A -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT capacity:
     A cell can hold a limited capacity per activity.
     A capacity is the maximum number of something in a given time range,
     e.g. number of customers shopping at the same time or number of
     workplaces.
     If this element is not specified, then the capacity of the defined
     activity is unlimited. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE value:
     Value of the capacity.
     format: unsigned integer -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT opentime:
     Each zone/activity combination can hold a variable amount of opening
     times describing on what times the facility is open and therefore
     accessible.
     The opening times are specified on a daily basis for maximum week periods.
     If no opentime element is specified, the facility is closed all the time.
     To make a facility open all the time, include the following opentime
     element:
     <opentime day="wk" start_time="00:00" end_time="24:00" />
     If no opentime element is specified, then the defined activity is always
     open. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE day:
     A schedule can be set for a single day, for all weekdays,
     the weekend or for the whole week. Schedules for single days always
     override schedules for time ranges, e.g. a "mon" schedule for
     Monday overrides weekday or whole week schedules.

     ATTENTION: for a given facility, schedules must
     not overlap in time. I.e.
       <opentime day="mon" start_time="09:00" end_time="14:00" />
       <opentime day="mon" start_time="11:00" end_time="18:00" />
     is not allowed.
     mon - Monday
     tue - Tuesday
     wed - Wednesday
     thu - Thursday
     fri - Friday
     sat - Saturday
     sun - Sunday
     wkday - week days (mon through fri)
     wkend - week end (sat, sun)
     wk - whole week (mon through sun)
     format: string (can only be chosen from given values) -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE start_time:
     Defines when a facility opens.
     format: compatible with the locale defined in xml:lang -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE end_time:
     Defines when a facility closes.
     format: compatible with the locale defined in xml:lang -->

<!-- If start_time > end_time, then the facility is opened over
     midnight. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT travelcard:
     Each available travel card of this person is listed here
     seperately. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Since the travel cards differ much from country to country,
     there is no common definition of it. So, only a defined
     string is used for that:
     First set the characters for the specific country (i.e. ch
     for Switzerland, de for Germany, and so on), followed by
     a dash and the the string which defines the type of the
     travelcard. At the moment available types are:
     ch-GA := "Generalabonoment" in Switzerland
     ch-HT := "Halbtax" in Switzerland -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT plan:
     Each person holds at least one plan.  A plan holds a sequence of
     act-leg-act-leg... tags.  Such a chain has to start and end with
     an act(ivity).  Between two acts there must be EXACTLY one
     leg. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE score:
     Measures the "performance" of this plan based on the outcome of
     the execution of this plan within the simulation (possibly
     several simulations).  After a plan is chosen for a simulation
     and is simulated by the sim, a score will be calculated.  So,
     initial plans don't need to provide a score.  It is just for
     internal use.
     format := double -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE age:
     How long this person has had this plan.  (E.g., number of
     iterations.)
     Not used yet (Oct. 2004).
     format := unsigned integer -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE selected:
     If a person has more than one plan, one is marked as the selected
     plan, i.e., the one to be used by the simulation or other
     modules.  For internal use.  Initial plans do not need to provide
     this. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT act:
     Defines an activity of a person (like working, shopping, etc.).
     An activity is placed on a defined coordinate/link of the given
     network. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Each activity has to have a type, like w(ork), l(eisure),
     h(ome), s(hopping), e(ducation), etc.
     format := string -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE x:
     The x coordinate of the activity.
     If x and y is not defined, the link id has to be given!
     format := double

<!-- ATTRIBUTE y:
     The y coordinate of the activity.
     If x and y is not defined, the link id has to be given!

     this attribute is not given, the x and y attributes must be
     defined.
     format := unsigned integer
     unit   := N/A -->

<!-- NOTE: Either (x,y) or link must be defined, otherwise the
           activity cannot be matched on the given network (see
           network_v1.dtd on matsim.org). -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE start_time:
     Defines when an activity should start.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE end_time:
     Defines when an activity should end.  This is a REQUIRED
     attribute for the FIRST activity, and optional for the other
     ones.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE dur:
     Defines the duration of an activity.  This is a REQUIRED
     attribute for all activities but not for the first one.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE ref_id:
     The id of an entry in the reference_layer.  optional. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT leg:
     Defines one part of the trip between two activities. (I.e. a
     route with the car, a walk by foot, a change of the mode, a time
     where it has to wait for the bus, and so on.)  At the moment,
     Matsim provides only 'car mode' legs. (Oct. 2004) -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE num:
     The numbering is done by Matsim, so there is no need to define
     that for the input plans.
     format := unsigned integer
     unit   := N/A -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE mode:
     Defines the mode of this leg (e.g. car, bus, foot, bike, etc.).
     Matsim only provides car at the moment (Oct. 2004).
     format := string -->

     Expected departure time for this leg.
     This is also for internal use.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

     Expected travel time for this leg.
     This is also for internal use.

     This is also for internal use.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT route:
     When a leg is a path through a network, it is defined here. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Defines the optimization type of the route. At the moment, a
     route can be optimized for distance, travel time, number of
     nodes passed, or number of intersections passed.
     format := string -->
