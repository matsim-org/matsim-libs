	// different path to the same destination, which is ok.  The relocate calls are marked as "deprecated" to discourage use,

	// disconnected trips.  kai, nov'17
	
	
	/*
	 * Design thoughts while adding access/egress walk legs to car trips:
	 * . Matsim has a computer science router (LeastCostPathCalculator, from node to node) and a behavioral router (RoutingModule, from
	 *    facility to facility).
	 * . For something like replanCurrentRoute it does not really make sense to start at a facility.
	 * . So it seems that for replanCurrentRoute, the computer science router makes more sense.
	 * . This is, however, not true for all the relocate calls, since they also need to reroute the egress leg.
	 * yyyy So, in short: all the relocate methods need to be adapted.  For "future", this is easy.  For "current", the splicing needs to be re-done.  kai, dec'15
	 * 
	 * Hm, next thought: It is not fully clear how relocateXxx has worked in the past, since also there the succeeding activity would 
	 * have needed adaptation. So in the end the method should just do what it promises (i.e. modify a single leg), and not
	 * think too much about its context.  (In the end, will presumably retrofit the mobsim in a way that it is able to process also the
	 * old car trips.)
