/**
 * This class serves as abstract super class for all jaxb api based xml parsers
 * within the MATSim framework. By using the validate() method of this class
 * jaxb based parsers can validate against xml schemas on- and offline. For
 * offline validation the SAXValidator capabilities of the MatsimXmlParser
 * super class are used.
 * Offline validation has to be done via SAX due to the fact that one can
 * use the jaxb validation by calling the following methods:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * Schema s = XMLSchemaFactory.newSchema(filename of local schema); 
 * Unmarshaller u.setSchema(s);
 * </code>
 * This unfortunately works only with schemas not including other 
 * schema documents which is no option within the MATSim framework.
 * Other workarounds exist, however they result in more complicated
 * code.
