	 * Design thoughts:<ul>
	 * <li> yy It does not make sense to me that both "timeSlot" and "now" are needed.  I guess that historically it was
	 * "timeSlot", and then "now" was needed for the time-dependent network.  But I would think that the conversion
	 * from "now" to "timeSlot" should be done inside the data class (implementation hiding) and so the "timeSlot" 
	 * argument should be removed.  kai, may'2011 </li>
	 * <li>Indead, this doesn't make sense at a quick glance. This is an optimization that saves lots of memory. For each
	 * link of the network a TravelTimeData Object is created. Each of these objects would need one (Map implementation) 
	 * or two (Array implementation) additional fields that hold the information that is required to calculate the time slot
	 * from the time of day. dg, april'2013. </li>
	 * <li> Well, one could insert the algo to compute the index from the time-of-day into the TravelTimeData implementing class. kai, jan'16
	 * <li> The main reason by both are needed seems to be the getFreeSpeed(...) at some point, which needs "now" as an argument.  
	 * We could, alternatively, return some "undefined" travel time (or an infinite standard deviation), and then now somewhere else
	 * that we need to use free speed as the alternative.  kai, jan'16
	 * </ul>
