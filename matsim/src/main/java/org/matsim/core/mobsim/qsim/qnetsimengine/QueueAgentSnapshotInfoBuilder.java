		 * In the old code version we had the problem that vehicles did not change position while changing the link,
		 * i.e. they had a positionEvent at time 10 at the junction coordinate (0,0) where the previous link ends,
		 * and the following link starts, then at time 11 they left the old link, entered the new link and had a new
		 * positionEvent at the very same coordinate (0,0) because this is the from coord of the second link.
		 *
		 * The current version tries to simplify this logic by calculating the vehicle's position by simply using
		 * v = s/t -> s = v*t. Because t is the remaining time s is the distance to the toNode. We have to therefore
		 * subtract s from the overall curvedLength to receive the distance from fromNode:
		 * curvedLength - s -> curvedLength - v*t -> curvedLength - freespeed * remainingTravelTime
		 *
		 * This will produce a constant motion since the qsim will generate only a single position for the timestep in
		 * which the vehicle has its link enter, link leave event when crossing two links. The last position on the old
		 * link will be the position of the toNode. The first position generated on the new link is going to be the
		 * timestep after the link enter event for that link occurred. janek june'21
