	 * {@link PassengerAccessEgress#handlePassengerEntering(PTPassengerAgent, double)} and
	 * {@link PassengerAccessEgress#handlePassengerLeaving(PTPassengerAgent, double)} to let
	 * passengers in and out the vehicle. This allows implementations of this interface to
	 * define different strategies, e.g. a very simple one where everybody enters and leaves at
	 * the same time, or one where first all passengers leave, and at a later time all passengers
	 * enter, etc.</p>
	 * <p>The method must return the time how long the vehicle will have to stay at least at the stop
	 * to let the passengers enter/exit. If the method returns a value > 0, the method will be called
	 * again at a later time for the same stop, as in between some additional people could have arrived
	 * that want to enter. Only if the method returns 0, it may continue on its route to the next stop.
