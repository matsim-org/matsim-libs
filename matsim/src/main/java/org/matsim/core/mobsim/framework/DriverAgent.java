	 * need this method. kai, nov'11
	 * <li> At least in theory, it is possible that a vehicle does not end up on the link where it wanted to go.  This is highly improbable if
	 * not impossible with the current design, but was easily possible with TRANSIMS, where a vehicle simply may not have been in
	 * the correct lane to make a desired turn.  kai/micha≈Ç, mar'17
