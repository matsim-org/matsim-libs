/**
 * This class is part of the refactoring of the QSim. For now, OTFVis is rather
 * tightly coupled with the QSim and therefore counteracts making the QSim more
 * dependency injection-friendly.
 * 
 * The idea is the following: ActiveQSimBridge lives in the outer controller
 * scope. Whenever a new QSim is created, it registers here and any other
 * component of MATSim that needs a handle to the current QSim can obtain it
 * from here.
 * 
 * This mostly replaces cases where people used e.g. MobsimInitializedEvent to
 * get a handle of the QSim. This happens only 2-3 times in the whole code base
 * and would be mostly avoidable by further cleaning up the injection tree.
 * 
 * Eventually, these issues should be resolved and this class should be deleted.
