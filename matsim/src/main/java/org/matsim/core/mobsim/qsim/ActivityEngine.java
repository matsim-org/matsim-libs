		// but queue it in with other such Agents and let them all leave on doSimStep(), because we expect those Agents to leave
		// in the order specified by the activityQueue (no matter if it is a good order or not, see comment there). The order in which new Agents enter
		// the simulation and are passed into this method is a different one, so this matters.
		// - This is safe (Agents will not miss a second), simply because doSimStep for this time step has not yet happened.
		// - It also means that e.g. OTFVis will probably display all Agents while they are in their first Activity before you press play.
		// - On the other hand, agents whose first activity is also their last activity go right to sleep "inside" this engine.
