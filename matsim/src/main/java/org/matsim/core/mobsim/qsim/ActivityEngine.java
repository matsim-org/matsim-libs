	//(default)ActivityEngine is very similar to TeleportationHandler (both are last handlers)
	// The name should more clearly express that intend.
	// Suggested names: NopActivityEngine, SleepActivityEngine, IdleActivityEngine, StaticActivityEngine???

 // "FallbackActivityHandler"?  I think that different from the TeleportationDepartureHandler, this one here can be replaced (with current design).
 // But maybe that is not a design decision, but just happened.  kai, jan'25
