 * Design comments:<ul>
 * <li>For the time being, factories should try to have as little state as possible.  Optimally, they have no state at all, i.e. everything
 * is done in the "create" method.
 * <li> (The above statement does not apply to anonymous implementations of factory interfaces ... since they can be considered ad-hoc
 * scripts where the sequence of actions is, in fact, determined by the script.)
