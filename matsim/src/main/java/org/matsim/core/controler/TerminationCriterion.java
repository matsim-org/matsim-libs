/**
 * This termination criterion defines whether a MATSim simulation run should
 * stop. A tricky aspect of this is that the criterion may decide whether to
 * stop the simulation based on information gather from the previous
 * iteration(s). However, if we decide that the iteration is "done" with this
 * criterion, it is already to late to write out, for instance, events for this
 * iteration, unless there were written out in any case. It is therefore
 * necessary to decode *before* an iteration if the iteration *may* be the last
 * iteration. In case criteria, e.g. for convergence, change, this interface
 * can, however, still decide that the iteration that was though to be the last
 * is in fact not the one. For that reason, there are two methods implemented.
