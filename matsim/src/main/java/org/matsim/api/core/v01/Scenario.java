/**
 * 
 * The scenario is the entry point to MATSim
 * scenarios. An implementation of Scenario
 * has to provide implementations
 * for the different return types, e.g. Network,
 * Facilities or Population.
 * 
 * <h3> Design aspects </h3>
 * <p>
 * Scenario (and in particular {@link MutableScenario}) now accepts arbitrary implementations of the contributing containers.  As stated
 * below, in some sense the whole scenario container is no longer necessary with the injection framework.  The containers themselves
 * should allow replaceable implementations, see {@link MatsimToplevelContainer}.
 * </p>
 * <h3> History </h3>
 * <p>
 * Originally, MATSim provided "global" variables such as access to the network with public static variables. 
 * </p><p>
 * This was changed around 2010 towards an approach where everything was moved around by non-static references.  The Scenario 
 * container was thus introduces to contain most of the objects that were public static before, so that reaching around one reference
 * would be enough for most purposes.  Reasons for that change include(d):<ul>
 * <li> Some people wanted to be able to have, say, two networks and/or two populations simultaneously in the code.  For example in order to compare them.
 * This was quite difficult with code that used public static variables.  (Clearly, one could put the desired scenario or network to the public
 * static reference, run the method, and then change it back.  Yet, ...)
 * <li> We never noticed it a lot since consistent regression testing was introduced <i> after </i> this change.  Yet when I introduce regression
 * tests for other software that uses public static variables excessively, I have to use a mode that constructs a new JVM every time a test
 * is started.  This works for integration tests since they use a fair amount of time anyways, but presumably makes unit testing much slower. 
 * <li> As an argument going into the same direction: Without global static variables, a class or method has access to what is given into 
 * it, but not more.  With global static variables, any class or method has access to everything that can be accessed that way.  This means
 * that one can never rely on a class or method to not change more than is visible from the outside, making reliably encapsulated modules 
 * close to impossible.
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * Around 2015, this was superseded by the (guice) injection approach.  Since with that it is possible to get the elements of the scenario
 * injected separately, the scenario container essentially does not seem to be necessary any more.  In retrospect, it might have been easier
 * to move from the public static approach to the injection approach right away, but we did not know this at that time.   
 * </p>
