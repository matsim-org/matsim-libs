<!-- ROOT ELEMENT facilities:
     Landuse data at the level of single organizations: shops, companies, houses. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE name:
     The name should describe of which kind of data this
     file holds. I.e. "Kanton Zurich - from database xyz".
     format: string -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE xml:lang:
     Used by i.e. Java to know how to format and parse
     times, dates, etc. according to a given locale (e.g. en_US, de_CH) -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT facility:
     A spatially aggregate organization where persons can perform activities.
     The coordinate system of the x,y coordinates has to be specified in a
     world file. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE id:
     Identification of a facility -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE x:
     x-coordinate of that facility.
     format: real number -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE y:
     y-coordinate of that facility.
     format: real number -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE linkId:
     id of a link in a network, on which this facility can be reached. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT activity:
     Defines spatial and temporal properties for
     a specific activity to be performed in a zone. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Activity type, e.g. work or shop.
     format: string (can only be chosen from given values) -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT capacity:
     A cell can hold a limited capacity per activity.
     A capacity is the maximum number of something in a given time range,
     e.g. number of costumers shopping at the same time or number of
     workplaces.
     If this element is not specified, then the capacity of the defined
     activity is unlimited. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE value:
     Value of the capacity.
     format: unsigned integer -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT opentime:
     Each zone/activity combination can hold a variable amount of opening
     times describing on what times the facility is open and therefore
     accessible.
     The opening times are specified on a daily basis for maximum week periods.
     If no opentime element is specified, the facility is closed all the time.
     To make a facility open all the time, include the following opentime
     element:
     <opentime day="wk" start_time="00:00" end_time="24:00" /> -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE day:
     A schedule can be set for a single day, for all weekdays,
     the weekend or for the whole week. Schedules for single days always
     override schedules for time ranges, e.g. a "mon" schedule for
     Monday overrides weekday or whole week schedules.

     ATTENTION: for a given facility, schedules must
     not overlap in time. I.e.
       <opentime day="mon" start_time="09:00" end_time="14:00" />
       <opentime day="mon" start_time="11:00" end_time="18:00" />
     is not allowed.
     mon - Monday
     tue - Tuesday
     wed - Wednesday
     thu - Thursday
     fri - Friday
     sat - Saturday
     sun - Sunday
     wkday - week days (mon through fri)
     wkend - week end (sat, sun)
     wk - whole week (mon through sun)
     format: string (can only be chosen from given values) -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE start_time:
     Defines when a facility opens.
     format: compatible with the locale defined in xml:lang -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE end_time:
     Defines when a facility closes.
     format: compatible with the locale defined in xml:lang -->

<!-- If start_time > end_time, then the facility is opened over
     midnight. -->
