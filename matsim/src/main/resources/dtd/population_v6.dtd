<!-- ROOT ELEMENT population:
     In here all individuals are stored including their desired
     plan. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE desc:
     It is always a good idea to give a plans file a description
     for better identification.
     Normally it should describe, which company / institute / etc..
     created that plans file and / or what has been modified. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT person:
     Each individual is listed here. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE id:
     Each person holds a UNIQUE id for identification.
     format := unsigned integer -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE sex:
     If known, each person has a sex. -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE age:
     If known, each person has an age.
     format := unsigned integer (inclusive zero) -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE license:
     Defines if this person holds a drivers-license. -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE car_avail:
     Defines if this person has access to a car (always, sometimes
     or never). -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE employed:
     Defines if this person has a job. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT plan:
     Each person holds at least one plan.  A plan holds a sequence of
     act-leg-act-leg... tags.  Such a chain has to start and end with
     an act(ivity).  Between two acts there must be EXACTLY one
     leg. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE score:
     Measures the "performance" of this plan based on the outcome of
     the execution of this plan within the simulation (possibly
     several simulations).  After a plan is chosen for a simulation
     and is simulated by the sim, a score will be calculated.  So,
     initial plans don't need to provide a score.  It is just for
     internal use.
     format := double -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE selected:
     If a person has more than one plan, one is marked as the selected
     plan, i.e., the one to be used by the simulation or other
     modules.  For internal use.  Initial plans do not need to provide
     this. -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT act:
     Defines an activity of a person (like working, shopping, etc.).
     An activity is placed on a defined coordinate/link of the given
     network. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Each activity has to have a type, like w(ork), l(eisure),
     h(ome), s(hopping), e(ducation), etc.
     format := string -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE x:
     The x coordinate of the activity.
     If x and y is not defined, the link id has to be given!
     format := double
     units  := meter -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE y:
     The y coordinate of the activity.
     If x and y is not defined, the link id has to be given!
     format := double
     units  := meter -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE link:
     The id of the link where this activity will be performed.  If
     this attribute is not given, the x and y attributes must be
     defined.
     format := unsigned integer
     unit   := N/A -->

<!-- NOTE: Either (x,y) or link must be defined, otherwise the
           activity cannot be matched on the given network (see
           network_v1.dtd on matsim.org). -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE facility:
     The id of the facility where this activity will be performed. Optional.
     format := unsigned integer
     unit   := N/A -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE start_time:
     Defines when an activity should start.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE end_time:
     Defines when an activity should end.  This is a REQUIRED
     attribute for the FIRST activity, and optional for the other
     ones.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE max_dur:
     Defines the maximum duration of an activity.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT leg:
     Defines one part of the trip between two activities. (I.e. a
     route with the car, a walk by foot, a change of the mode, a time
     where it has to wait for the bus, and so on.)  At the moment,
     MATSim provides only 'car mode' legs. (Oct. 2004) -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE mode:
     Defines the mode of this leg (e.g. car, bus, foot, bike, etc.).
     format := string -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE dep_time:
     Expected departure time for this leg.
     This is also for internal use.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE trav_time:
     Expected travel time for this leg.
     This is also for internal use.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE arr_time:
     Expected arrival time for this leg.
     This is also for internal use.
     format := "hh:mm:ss" -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ELEMENT route:
     When a leg is a path through a network, it is defined here. -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE type:
     Defines the kind of route, and in what "format" the route is encoded.
     format := string -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTE trav_time:
     the estimated travel time of the given route
     format := unsigned double -->

<!-- #PCDATA:
     encoding of the route, depending on the type specified -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->
