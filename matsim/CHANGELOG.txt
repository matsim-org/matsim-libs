Release Fall 2010 (version 0.2.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main focus of this release:
Simulation of public transport, Improvements to OTFVis, Code cleanup


Changes:

- New features:
  - OTFVis (org.matsim.run.OTFVis) can now be started in Swing mode (-swing).
    In Swing-Mode, no OpenGL is required, but only very limited capabilities
    are available (Network-Viewing, simple visualization of vehicles)
  - NetVis was removed from MATSim, use OTFVis in Swing mode instead.
  - Simulation of public transport possible
    see tutorial on http://matsim.org/docs/tutorials/transit

- Feature improvements:
  - improved stability of OsmNetworkReader to convert networks from OpenStreetMap
  - Swing-OTFVis can open mvi-files created by conversion from events

- Other changes for developers:

  API-Changes:
  - ScenarioImpl.getPopulation() returns Population instead of PopulationImpl (r11288)
  - A bunch of classes no longer implement or extend Serializable, mostly for Network and Population data structure (r11637, r11638, r11650 - r11653, r11655)
  - remove no longer supported config parameters (r11975, <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=F3A57F88000BEE4FBC74E5DC0562E8D987E9CF%40axonlu-msvr2.teledata.local&forum_name=matsim-devel>)
  - Use String instead of enum TransportMode for specifying modes of transportation (r11985, r11987)

  Non-API Changes:
  - QVehicle.getBasicVehicle() has been renamed to QVehicle.getVehicle()
  - org.matsim.withinday removed completely
  - World, Layer data structures removed completely
  - Completely re-engineered signalsystems implementation


Please note that OTFVis may not be able to read mvi-files created with an older release of MATSim.
Please make sure your mvi-files work as expected in OTFVis before deleting any older release of
MATSim. In the case of problems, it might be useful to keep the old release around just for
looking at old mvi-files.




Release version 0.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- two examples in tutorial.* did not work as expected



Release Spring 2010 (version 0.1.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main focus of this release:
Code stability and performance improvements, not so much about new features for users.


Changes:

- Changed System Requirements to Java 6

- New features:
  - handling events in a separate thread for speed up of runs (http://matsim.org/node/238)
  - conversion of OpenStreetMap-data for networks (see org.matsim.core.utils.io.OsmNetworkReader)
  - events can be written in an XML format to better accomodate attributes from new events

- Feature improvements:
  - improved visualizer OTFVis:
    show middle line of a road, save configuration, save views, start without argument, change speed, etc.
  - improved speed of default QueueSimulation
  - Events can be configured to be written only every n-th iteration 
    (speed due to less file I/O) (see http://matsim.org/node/344)
  - routing algorithms (Dijkstra, A*Landmarks) run faster (commit r8399)
  - faster writing of events and plans-files (commit r8867)
  - Planomat can now also do mode choice (see http://matsim.org/node/381)

- Other changes for users:
  - use Dijkstra as default routing algorithm instead of A*-Landmarks
  - improved travel time calculation (r6767)
  - lots of bug fixes, too many to list them here
  - Simulation can handle non-car legs by means of simple teleportation

- Other changes for developers:
  - moved project structure and Build process to Maven
  - first steps towards stable API for programmers (see package org.matsim.api.*)
    Developers which cannot commit to the MATSim repository should try to only use
    classes/interfaces from this package. If you need additional functionality from
    other classes, please speak to us, as we cannot guarantee for other classes to
    remain stable to the next release!
  - code cleanup towards API
  - renamed several classes and packages
  - improved code quality based on static code analysis
  - made scoring function more modular (see http://matsim.org/node/263)
  - introduce Scenario-class as Super-Element containing pointers to other data containers
    (see org.matsim.api.Scenario)
  - use Builders to create Population and Network
  - use (API-)Interfaces instead of Implementations in many playces
  - try domain driven design, ues Ids instead of object references between data containers (like Network, Population, ...)
  - Bugfix: QuadTree.values().iterator() did not return all values (r8303, r8863)
